  AA1_fourteen_words_desc:0 ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for gnomish children." - From a speech by the first Gnomeler of Chiselwick. The gnomish people were pushed from the west when the Dragonwake came. They were pushed from the east where they had settled when the Greentide came. Twice have hordes of uncivilized beings spewn from the caves and mountains in and around where gnomes have called home. Never again can we allow ourselves to be pushed from our home. The first Gnomeler's words echo whenever times get tough. The gnomish people deserve a safe place to call home. We will not be pushed out a third time."

  AA1_gnommish_brilliance_desc:0 "None are so brilliant in the ways of engineering and artifice as the gnomes, and those of Chiselwick are no exception. Long did many of their forefathers serve Castanor, and the remnant kingdoms that followed, providing their expertise to bigger folk at modest wage. That excellence in craft hasn't changed, but who they work for and the reward they receive has. Gnomes for gnomes."

  AA1_honorary_gnomes_desc:0 "While gnomes are hearty in spirit and advanced in technology, one thing that they do lack is the sheer number that biggers or especially some of the monstrous races like goblins or kobolds can produce. The inventions by gnomish scientists are wonderful, and those made for war are deadlier than any other, but guns are no good without people to fire them. Therefore, the Gnomeler wisely decided to integrate honorable non-biggers, such as dwarves and halflings, into the military, dubbing them "honorary gnomes" for the duty they carry out for Chiselwick."

  AA1_pinkshirts_desc:0 "As Chiselwick expanded to cover not just a small town in the ruins of Escann, but a collection of many villages and cities filled with bigger folk, including orcs leftover from the Greentide, disgruntlement grew toward their gnomish rulers, and the biggers lashed out. Riots encompassed cities, and many gnomish lives were lost in quelling those fires. To stop any revolt from getting to that stage ever again, the sitting Gnomeler created a new paramilitary force of gnomes - dubbed colloquially the pinkshirts for the bright pink uniforms they wore while conducting their duties in keeping the land under control of Chiselwick safe from would-be rebels."

  AA1_replace_merchant_desc:0 "Much the same as the problem the first Gnomeler faced with industry did those who followed him face with trade. Humans, elfs, and other biggers came, bearing much needed supplies, but, capitalizing on the tragedy of the Greentide, they used their position to charge exorbitant prices for their goods. Eventually, as crown stockpiles ran out, once again the gnomish hand was forced, and the goods coming in were seized. After the first caravan was taken by the state, the would-be traders in Chiselwick fled for fear of losing their goods, and no more came. Still, the trade had to flow, so the Gnomeler set up a new state trading apparatus, run exclusively by gnomish traders."

  AA1_state_industry_desc:0 "As the Greentide washed over Eastern Cannor and the orcish hordes began to topple the nations there within, the gnomes who would come to call themselves citizens of Chiselwick were pushed out of their homes and forced west. Increasingly, as what supplies they had taken with them dwindled, the demand for food grew, and those humans and other bigger folk who had been settled in the region were reluctant to share what grain and meat they had with the starving gnomes. Something had to be done, so the first Gnomeler of Chiselwick stepped up, and seized the farms by force. This method of state controlled industry has kept up within Chiselwick since then, and state-appointed gnomes run most industry within the country.."

  AA1_gnomestown_desc:0 "Chiselwick would continue to expand, and new Gnomelers would find themselves at the head of the nation, but never were the old elite forgotten. Those ancient gnomes who knew the suffering of the Greentide, and had stood up against it. These gnomes, exemplars of the descendants of the hierarchy were given great honors, and their advice on all things war was most trusted, for those gnomes had experienced battles of scales not seen by our people in a millennia. Every year they are celebrated, called the Day of Gnomestown in remembrance of when these veterans were first gathered together and integrated into Chiselwick's officer corps."
