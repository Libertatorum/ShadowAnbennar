 gnomeler_kill_patricians.2000.desc:0 "In [GetYear], the supreme GETMONARCHTITLE GETMONARCHNAME ordered the death of every patrician residing anywhere within the walls of Castonath. Grown tired of the bigger's de-facto control over the city, their constant lack of cooperation, and their borderline treasonous actions against the state, the order for TPD (Total Patrician Death) was signed, and a group of pinkshirts slipped into the city as night fell; by morning, the Patrician class of Castonath was no more. In what some are calling the "Second Night of Short Legs," every last Patrician in the city was hunted down and killed. Many were beheaded, hung, defenestrated, kicked into the cobblestone, thrown into trash heaps, and at least one was shot from a catapult into an active fire. Now, the Patricians are dead, and nothing stands between GETMONARCHNAME and the total control over the great city of Castonath. "
